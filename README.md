# CricketToPhone
This app notify the subscriber about status of the subscribe match

You have been assigned to implement a system called ‘CrickToPhone’. In this system, an
application server records the statistics of currently playing cricket matches. A cricket fan can
receive these match updates to his mobile phone. To start receiving the updates of a match, the
mobile application must first inform the application server that it is interested in a particular match
(Assume that each match is identified by a unique integer identifier). A fan can unregister from
receiving updates of a particular match at any time. The application server sends updates of a
match only to the applications that registered for it. At a given time, the server should be able to
manage statistics of more than one match.
